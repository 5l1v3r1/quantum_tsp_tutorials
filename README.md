# Quantum TSP tutorial

## Introduction

This repository contains code with tutorials on how to approach optimization problems using quantum computing.
I used Travelling Salesman Problem for this tutorials, though the idea is, that after finishing it, you should be able to implement any similar optimization problem.

## Is this tutorial right for you?

I have created this tutorial with specific audience in mind. It means people, who:
- are curious about quantum computing,
- don't have any background in quantum physics,
- have some programming experience,
- really want to learn this topic.

The last point is really the most important. I will use LEGO blocks analogy. This tutorial is not a set of bricks with a step-by-step instruction.
The instruction lacks some pages, but gives you clues how to get to the next stage. Figuring out what are some of the steps might take you even a couple of hours, but that's on purpose - the more you do by yourself, the more you will learn and understand.

I don't want to say that it is super advanced and hard - I tried to explain all the concepts as clearly as I could. But I wanted this tutorial to be at least a little bit of challenge, because this kind of tutorials are those I like best :)

## Warning

In this tutorial I used pyquil 2.0.0.dev0 and grove 1.8.0 . API of the functions may change drastically in next versions, so keep it in mind if something doesn't work for you!
